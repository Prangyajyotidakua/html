    <p>wheat momos recipe | veg wheat momos recipe | atta momos recipe with step by step photo
        and video.
        while momos recipe is a popular street food of india served and sold in every corner of street.
         however momos recipe is a delicacy from nepal and tibet region which is typically stuffed with 
         combination of veggies and meat. perhaps due to the migrating communities of south asian has helped to 
         make it a popular healthy snack.<br><br><br>

       i have already shared a traditional version of momos recipe prepared with all purpose flour or maida.
       however i use to get several requests for a healthy momos recipe with healthy stuffing and especially with 
       wheat. it took me a while to share this healthy wheat or atta momos but i had to share it soon. while the
        stuffing is more or less the same in both recipe but i have used purple cabbage which gives it a nice 
        taste and texture. i typically enjoy this with momos chutney recipe but it can also be consumed with 
        schezwazsauce recipe.
