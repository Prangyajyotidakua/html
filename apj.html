                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in the 
                pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil 
                Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was
                 a housewife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now
                  uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.

                Kalam at Bijnor a week before his death
                On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" 
                at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some
                 discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only
                  five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed.
